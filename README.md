## About DB for Women

Feminist theory sees a connection between all kinds of violence and worldwide security to local matters. Through the DB for women project in Germany, we're striving to build an environment where women can exist fearlessly. We've created an app targeting young and susceptible women who depend on public transportation, allowing them to map out secure paths based on the reviews of other women and identify safe areas. The app mitigates fear for the users and their community, and it incorporates an emergency panel for immediate communication, incident documentation, and evidence collection.
