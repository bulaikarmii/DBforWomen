## About DB for Women

Feminist theory links all forms of violence and global security to local issues. Our goal, via the DB for women initiative in Germany, is to create a world where women can live without fear. We've developed an app for young and vulnerable women who rely on public transport, enabling them to plan safe routes using other women's station ratings and locate safe spots. The app reduces fear for individuals and their communities, and features an emergency board for quick contact, incident reporting, and evidence recording. It also promotes "trainsharing" â€“ women traveling together for added safety.
